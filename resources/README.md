# About GeoPose Web Resources

On the OGC GeoPose web site (GeoPose.org) there are two pages on which logos of companies appear.

On the Contributors page, the logos of those in the GeoPose SWG.

On the Implementers page, the logos of any business that has implemented GeoPose 1.0.

There is also a gallery page planned. The gallery will feature images of a product or service that illustrates the use of GeoPose 1.0.
